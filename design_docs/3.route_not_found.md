# Route not found

## Goals
  - Be transparent when the route was not found
  - Avoid errors

## Scenarios

  1. User navigates to /route-not-exist
  2. User navigates to /products/:id/route-not-exist

When navigating to an unknown route the default should be to stay on the same url and display a not found widget. If there is any partial match they should be in the stack

It should also be possible to redirect to the home page.


## Avoid errors

### Option design 1

```
Router(
  notFound: Route(...)
)
```

when a route is not found we build the not found route
