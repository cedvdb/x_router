# Route not found

## Goals
  - Be transparent when the route was not found
  - Avoid errors

## Scenarios

  1. User navigates to /route-not-exist
  2. User navigates to /products/:id/route-not-exist



*Should both scenarios navigate to a "route not found route" ?* 

An user could be redirected to the first matching route going up the segments
or we could have a route not found. 
If going up the route segments, no partially matching route was found then a not found route still has to be displayed.

It seems it would be more transparent to always have a not found route


## Avoid errors

### Option design 1

```
Router(
  notFound: Route(...)
)
```

when a route is not found we build the not found route
